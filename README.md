## Disclaimer
This repository has no other purpose but sharing.
I want to share my hackintosh configuration for this particular laptop with the whole world.
This is not a step by step guide, rather a thing that can greatly help you on your way of turning this or similar laptop into a hackintosh.
Though you can just grab and use this if you have same or very similar laptop model, I greatly encourage you not do so, but instead read all the things I will mention below and get some knowledge.

### Where to begin
At the moment there is one main, up-to-date, generic hackintosh guide that is worthy of your attention - https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/, one trick with it that it is meant for desktop, and as you know we have a laptop here, so here's another one which is still work in progress https://dortania.github.io/vanilla-laptop-guide/.  
This hackintosh configuration has been made from scratch thanks to those guides, and you should be able to make it for yourself too. If in doubt, or something's not covered in there you can check with this repo's files while you go along.

### Specific things
* **BIOS** You will have to change DVMT pre-alloc size to 64mb, and you can't do that via stock BIOS, please see how-to in here - https://github.com/stonevil/Razer_Blade_Advanced_early_2019_Hackintosh#bios-unlock
* **GPIO pinning** There are hotpatches & ssdts that might be specific for a particular laptop, I think trackpad GPIO pinning might be one of them, please check your pin number as per - https://voodooi2c.github.io/#GPIO%20Pinning/GPIO%20Pinning, and modify SSDT-I2C if needed (currently pin number is set to 0x64 in there)
